## Intro

Welcome to the bowels of my portfolio!

As you can see its build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Also I'm using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling rather than normal ```css```, because I believe it makes styling and code maintenance much easier. Finally I'm using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for check the types of my components.
